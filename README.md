Hi! How are you doing?
Becoming a programmer is easy but keeping it up is hard.
I wasted my 2 years just coding and not doing any project so I now learn from my mistake and I'm going to fill it with projects.

This is a scientific calculator and I think you will like it.
It's not a big thing but a great opening.

The site is online for free:

God be with you!
